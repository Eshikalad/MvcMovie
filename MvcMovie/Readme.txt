Part 1: I started a new project with the Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) template. The project was given the name "MVCMovie,"
and when the program was launched, a welcome message appeared.

Part 2: Add a controller named "HelloWorldController.cs" to the project. I changed the program.cs file to include two parameters: "name" and "numTimes." 
This tweak enabled dynamic outputs based on different values for "name" and "numTimes."

Part 3: I added a view titled "index.cshtml" to the project. The HTML design code in this view has been updated to improve the visual appeal. 
In addition, I changed the style of the index view and established a new folder called "HelloWorld" to group the related components. 
The "Welcome" class in this folder has been changed to incorporate a loop that displays the message a set number of times ("numTimes").

Part 4: Adding the "Movie.cs" class to the model was a vital development step. Following that, I used the controller's scaffold command to construct
the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) activities required by the specification. The following stages included starting the initial migration with the
commands "add-migration InitialCreate" and "update-database." The migration file, 
"20240131235413_InitialCreate,"
was evaluated and adjusted as necessary.

Part 5: I developed a "SeedData" class in the model folder to populate the SQL Server database. This class included code that represented the database's initial 
data. To execute the application, changes were made to the program.cs file, allowing the database to be accessed via localhost.I did not able to fetch the databse I got error.

In Part 6, I established the project structure to ensure clear and coherent code organization. Documentation and comments were added as needed to improve
the codebase's readability and understanding. This complete strategy aimed to provide a well-structured and maintainable Model-View-Controller (MVC) application.
